    opening:
      'Chakrata is not chosen for convenience. It is chosen for stillness, altitude, forest density, and silence. Two thousand meters above the plains, in a Himalayan forest where sound travels differently and time moves slower, this is where minds settle and hearts listen.' +
      ' Easily accessible from Dehradun — yet distant enough from human noise that the silence becomes thick.',

    title: 'Why Both Stillness & Movement Thrive Here',
    description:
      'Chakrata is not only for silent retreat. The forest itself invites movement — walking, gentle hiking, embodied practice. The same forest density that creates stillness for meditation creates beauty for movement. Altitude that calms the thinking mind also grounds the body during yoga or tai chi. You can retreat into silence. Or you can retreat into motion through the land. The place holds both.',

    'Chakrata is one of several Himalayan locations we work with — each chosen for different kinds of inner work. We return to Chakrata for people seeking accessible-yet-removed silence, forest immersion, and the particular medicine of this altitude and forest density. If you are seeking higher peaks, remote trekking, or raw wilderness, Sankri may be the location your retreat reaches for instead.',
