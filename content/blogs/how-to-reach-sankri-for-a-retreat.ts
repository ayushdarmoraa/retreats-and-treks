<h2>How to Reach Sankri for a Retreat</h2>
<p>Sankri is a village in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, situated at a higher elevation than many other Himalayan retreat destinations. Its remoteness is part of what makes it suitable for deeper immersion retreats, but the journey requires more planning than shorter-distance locations.</p>
<h3>Reaching Sankri from Delhi</h3>
<p>The journey from Delhi to Sankri typically takes between 12 to 15 hours by road. The standard route passes through Haridwar or Rishikesh, continues to Uttarkashi, and then ascends to Sankri via Mori and Purola.</p>
<p>Participants are advised to plan this as an overnight journey or allow a full day for travel. Early morning departures from Delhi can allow arrival at Sankri by late evening, avoiding mountain driving in complete darkness.</p>
<h3>Reaching Sankri from Dehradun</h3>
<p>Dehradun is the most practical base for participants arriving by train or flight. From Dehradun, the road journey to Sankri takes approximately 8 to 10 hours depending on road conditions and seasonal factors.</p>
<p>Many retreat participants prefer arranging a private vehicle from Dehradun, as public transport options to Sankri are limited and may require connections at Uttarkashi or Purola.</p>
<h3>Via Haridwar or Rishikesh</h3>
<p>Haridwar and Rishikesh are natural waypoints for those traveling by train. From either town, a hired vehicle to Sankri is the most reliable option. The route from Rishikesh passes through Tehri and Uttarkashi before reaching the upper valley road toward Sankri.</p>
<h3>Seasonal Road Conditions</h3>
<p>Road conditions above Uttarkashi vary significantly by season. Monsoon months can bring occasional disruptions due to landslides or roadwork. Winter may require snow-capable vehicles for the final stretch. Spring and autumn generally offer the most stable travel conditions.</p>
<p>Retreat organizers typically coordinate shared transfers and provide specific route guidance in advance.</p>
<h3>Arrival Planning</h3>
<p>Because Sankri involves extended travel, retreat programs here generally begin the day after arrival to allow participants adequate rest. Factor in travel fatigue when planning departure dates from home.</p>
